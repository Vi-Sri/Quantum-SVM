# Support Vector Machines with Classical and Quantum Kernels

This repository contains implementations of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using Python and the CVXOPT library, including:

Linear SVM: Solving the SVM dual problem for linearly separable data.
SVM with Gaussian Kernel: Extending the SVM to non-linear, non-separable data using the Gaussian (RBF) kernel.
SVM with Quantum Kernel: Implementing a quantum kernel using Qiskit to explore quantum-enhanced machine learning.

## Description
This project demonstrates how to implement SVMs for classification tasks using different kernel methods:

Linear Kernel: Suitable for linearly separable data.
Gaussian (RBF) Kernel: Handles non-linear relationships by mapping data into higher-dimensional space.
Quantum Kernel: Utilizes quantum computing principles to compute kernel functions, potentially capturing complex patterns in data.
